Web App created using REACTJS with TYPESCRIPT and VITE
By Gareth Too Yu Sheng

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Installing NodeJS

If you already have NodeJS installed on your machine, feel free to skip this step.

To run this project, you need to install NodeJS. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
If you are new to NodeJS I would recommend installing the latest LTS version. Select a suitable installer for your
machine, download and install it. In the installer, leave everything as the default and finish the installation.

For a clearer installation process, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FAtFwKVhn0).

### 2. Running the Project

Once NodeJS has been installed, open up this project in a terminal.
In the main project folder, run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.

To run the project, in the same terminal run `npm run dev` to start the project.
Once Vite has loaded, open up `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser of choice to view the React App.
