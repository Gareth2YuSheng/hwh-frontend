## Setting Up the Project

Best to setup the [backend](https://github.com/Gareth2YuSheng/hwh-backend) of the project before this.

### 0. Downloading the Github Repository

If you have already downloaded and unzipped the Github Repo, please skip ahead to the next steps.

To download the Github Repo, at the top of the page select _Code > Download ZIP_ to download the repo.
![download repo](https://github.com/Gareth2YuSheng/hwh-frontend/blob/main/docs/readmeImages/download_repo.png)

Save the zip somewhere on your local machine. After downloading, extract the project.
After extracting the project, you should see a folder containing all the source code for the project.
![download repo](https://github.com/Gareth2YuSheng/hwh-frontend/blob/main/docs/readmeImages/unzipped_repo.png)

Moving forward I will refer to this folder as the _main project directory_.

### 1. Installing NodeJS

If you already have NodeJS installed on your machine, feel free to skip this step.

To run this project, you need to install NodeJS. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

If you are new to NodeJS I would recommend installing the latest LTS version. Select a suitable installer for your
machine, download and install it.

![node download](https://github.com/Gareth2YuSheng/hwh-frontend/blob/main/docs/readmeImages/node_download.png)

In the installer, leave everything as the default and finish the installation.

For a clearer installation process, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FAtFwKVhn0).

### 2. Running the Project

Once NodeJS has been installed, open up this project in a terminal.
In the main project folder, run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.

To run the project, in the same terminal run `npm run dev` to start the project.
Once Vite has loaded, open up `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser of choice to view the React App.
